				<p class="body-copy">This week on my journey to learn Javascript, I encountered functions and event handlers. To improve my knowledge and as a challenge to myself, I wanted to build my own sign up page and try and mimic the ones you see everyday in the wild.</p>

				<p class="body-copy">Create a sign up form to better understand how forms work after user clicks submit, the use of Javascript event handler’s role with them, and implementing Regular Expressions and functions to test form inputs.</p>

				<p class="body-copy">Sign up forms are all too common these days with virtually every website you find on the web incorporating it. And of course, it makes complete sense. Businesses want you to sign up so they have your information. Take a look at some of those businesses such as <span><a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">Stripe</a></span>,<span><a href="https://identity.getpostman.com/signup"> Postman</a></span>, and <span><a href="https://www.espn.com/"> ESPN</a></span>.</p>

				<p class="body-copy">So what better way to show employers that I understand (or at least have dabbled with) sign up forms than creating my own fully-ish functioning form.</p>

					#Design

				        <p class="body-copy">Making every page or screen self-evident is like having good lighting in a store: it just makes everything seem better..</p>

				<p class="body-copy">
					Design plays a key role in any project. After all, the design and look of any project is the first thing the user sees after the page loads. The user need to be able to tell instantly that this is a sign up page based on the layout and look and instinctively know what to do. Navigating through the site needs to be effortless and seamless and the user should not have to think at all. Oh and the site has to also be completely responsive so it can view it on any device.

				<h3 class="fourth-level-heading">##What-We-Need</h3>
				<ul class="what-we-need body-copy">
					<li>Inputs with easy distinctions for:
						<ul>
							<li>First Name</li>
							<li>Last Name</li>
							<li>Email Address</li>
							<li>Password</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Submit Button that provided feedback for success or error</li>
					<li>Site to be fully responsive</li>	
				</ul>

				<p class="body-copy">I usually start every design mockup the same way our forefathers did: with good ol’ pen and paper.</p>
