				<p class="body-copy">This week on my journey to learn Javascript, I encountered functions and event handlers. To improve my knowledge and as a challenge to myself, I wanted to build my own sign up page and try and mimic the ones you see everyday in the wild.</p>

				<p class="body-copy">Create a sign up form to better understand how forms work after user clicks submit, the use of Javascript event handlerâ€™s role with them, and implementing Regular Expressions and functions to test form inputs.</p>

				<p class="body-copy">Sign up forms are all too common these days with virtually every website you find on the web incorporating it. And of course, it makes complete sense. Businesses want you to sign up so they have your information. Take a look at some of those businesses such as <span><a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">Stripe</a></span>,<span><a href="https://identity.getpostman.com/signup"> Postman</a></span>, and <span><a href="https://www.espn.com/"> ESPN</a></span>.</p>

				<p class="body-copy">So what better way to show employers that I understand (or at least have dabbled with) sign up forms than creating my own fully-ish functioning form.</p>
