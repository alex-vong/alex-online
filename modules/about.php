			<p class="body-copy intro">
				My journey into web development began during the pandemic where in the midst of navigating a career change I stumbled upon Kevin Powell's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell">YouTube</a> channel. And althought I did not understand anything the manw as doing, I spent the next hour watching him build a website from scratching using HTML and CSS. I was completely blown away and mesmerized and what he was able to create and in that short hour, a whole new world opened before my eyes.

				In the year and a half following that eventful day, I've spent hundred of hours cultivating my passion for web development and have turned them into this personal portfolio site where I designed, mocked up, incorporated projects into, and deployed using resources and mentors I have gathered on the internet.
			</p>

			<p class="body-copy">I am truly proud of this personal site as it is a testament to all the time and effort I put into this journey and it repreents myself as a developer</p>

			<p class="body-copy">I am now looking for a junior web developer position to finally kick start my career and learn among professionals.</p>

			<p class="body-copy">I have been mainly building things for myself but I am now looking for a <span class="occupation">Junior Front-End Developer</span> position to finally kick build things for other people.</p>

			<p class="body-copy intro">
				Outside of development my passions include discovering new coffee shops and restuarants, staying updated with all the new technologies, as well as movie & Disney news, and learning to become a Master Chef using the my air fryer.
