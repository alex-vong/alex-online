 			<p class="body-copy">
 				My journey into web development began during the height of the pandemic when I stumbled upon a video by Brad Traversy. Despite not understanding what I was watching, I found myself drawn to the video, watching intently as he built a landing page using only HTML and CSS. This sparked a new interest within me and set me down the road to becoming a web developer.

 			<p class="body-copy">
 				I've spent the past year and a half delving deep into both the world of web development and design. I've spent many hours a day honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have come to love the process of designing projects using tools such as Figma, Affinity Designer, Sketch, and Whimsical. I have been using the skills I've learned to design, build, and deploy various projects, including this portfolio which showcases my work. I am incredibly proud of how this portfolio has turned out, encapsulating the sum total of everything I have learned in my journey thus far. I view this portfolio as an ever-evolving work in progress, as I plan to continuously enhance and improve it with new features and capabilities as I continue to learn and grow.
 				<span class="block">
 					Outside of web development, I indulge in my passions for sports, the theatre & arts, the latest technology trends & releases, traveling to new places, and cooking up new recipes with my trusty air fryer. </span>

 				<span class="block">
 					I a currently seeking employment as a <span class="occupation">Junior Front-End Developer</span>. I am eager to work alongside other professionals and contribute my skills to the design and development of web applications for clients.
