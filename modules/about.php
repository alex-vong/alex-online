				<h2 class="second-level-heading"><?=ucfirst($page)?> Me</h2>

				<p class="body-copy intro">
					I like to create projects using purposeful design and goal-driven development. I specialize in creating websites and applications that focus on simplicity, usability, and responsiveness. I enjoy design and technology and the infinite ways the two can converge to create online experiences.  
				</p>

				<p class="body-copy intro">
					Outside of development my passions include discovering new coffee shops and restuarants, staying updated with all the new technologies, as well as movie & Disney news, and learning to become a Master Chef using the my air fryer.

				<p class="body-copy intro">
					I am currently seeking employment as a Front-End Web Developer. You can contact or follow along with my work, personal projects, and occasional insights into my life.
