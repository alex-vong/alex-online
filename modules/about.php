			<p class="body-copy">
				My journey into web development began during the height of the pandemic. I was in the midst of navigating a career change when, by sheer happenstance, I stumbled upon a YouTube tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell">Kevin Powell</a>.

				<span class="block">
				And although I did not understand anything he as doing, I spent the next hour watching him build a website from scratching using HTML and CSS. I was completely blown away and mesmerized and what he was able to create and in that short hour, a whole new world opened before my eyes. I then remember going from thinking to myself "I wish I could build webpages, it looks extremely fun" to "wait a minute, there is no reason why I can't build webpages!" And thus, my life as a web developer began.

			<p class="body-copy">
				In the year and a half following that eventful day, I've spent hundred of hours cultivating my passion for web development and have turned them into this personal portfolio site where I designed, mocked up, incorporated projects into, and deployed using resources and mentors I have gathered on the internet.

				<span class="block">
					I am truly proud of this personal site and the projects I have done over the year as they are a testament to all the time and effort I put into this journey and it represents myself as a developer
				</span>

				<span class="block">
					I have been mainly building things for myself, but I am now looking for a <span class="occupation">Junior Front-End Developer</span> position to kickstart my web development career and build things for other people while continuing to learn among professionals..
