	    <p class="body-copy">The quote above sums up my entire web development journey. Early on, I remember being too afraid to start a project due to the paranoia and belief thats I was simply not ready. Instead, I would continue to watch tutorial after tutorial and watch other people build things.</p>

	    <p class="body-copy">It was only after I started building things that I began to understanding the topics and concepts. Constantly building something is one of the greatest learning tools a developer has at their disposal.</p>

	    <p class="body-copy">I will never stop building things because as soon as I do, I will stop learning. So here are a few things I've designed and built:</p>
