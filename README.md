# Hello!

This is my personal portfolio website I made for myself for Perpetual Educations ["Design for The Web"](https://perpetual.education/) Mentorship.

# Goal

Using what I have learned throughout this mentorship (goal driven design, typography, colors, layouts, HTML, CSS, responsive layout, PHP, query strings and PHP routing, and soon to come Javascript) to create a personal portfolio site for myself to get hired.
